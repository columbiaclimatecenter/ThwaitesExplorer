<p><u>Thwaites Glacier </u>drains a large area of the West Antarctic ice Sheet, extending over 192,000 sq kms (74,000 sq miles), an area the size of Florida or the island of Britain, and one of the most rapidly changing glaciers in Antarctica. Thwaites straddles some of the <i>deepest</i> bedrock in Antarctica, and over the past 30 years the amount of ice flowing from this 120 km-wide region has <i>doubled</i>. Ice moving off the land into the ocean will affect global sea level, but <i><b>how much </b>and<b> how fast?</b></i></p>
<p>The US National Science Foundation (NSF) and UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) have combined forces supporting eight separate research and modeling projects with over 60 scientists and students to investigate this rapidly changing area through  the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC). </p>
<p><u>Using the Thwaites-Explorer App:</u></p>
<p>Explore Thwaites Glacier by selecting a topic to bring up a map. Each map is <u>interactive:</u> just click the continent to bring up data embedded in the images. Short audio supports can also be activated for each map. </p>
