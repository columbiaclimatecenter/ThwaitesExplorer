Height of Antarctic Ice: Ice elevation and volume are both important for ice stability. This map of Antarctica divided into contours of elevation at mainly 500 meter steps. The lowest (yellow) at 0 to 100 meters (0-330 ft) is the floating ice shelves that extend off the ice sheet and border much of Antarctica. The highest (white) at 3500-4100 meters (11,500-13450 ft), is deep in the interior of East Antarctica. The elevation contours include a combination of the topography of the land below and the layer of thick ice above that covers 97% of Antarctica.
Thwaites is in West Antarctica, which overall has much lower elevation than East Antarctica making the ice more susceptible to a warming ocean. All of Antarctica holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by 60 meters (200 ft.). The Thwaites region in West Antarctica is considered vulnerable, and holds enough ice to add 2/3 of a meter of sea level rise (2 ft.). Its collapse could release additional ice for a total of 3 meters (10 ft.) of sea level rise.
