Antarctic Ice Sheet elevation: This elevation map divides Antarctica into contours using mostly 500  meter intervals.  The lowest contour,  0 to 100 meters (0-330 ft) of elevation, is the floating ice shelves that border much of Antarctica  (shown in yellow). The highest contour, 3500-4100 meters (11,500-13450 ft), is deep in the interior of East Antarctica (shown in white). The contours represent a combination of the underlying topography and the layer of thick ice that covers the 97% of Antarctica. 

It is important to think about not only the volume of ice in the Antarctica Ice Sheet but the elevation of that ice.  Thwaites sits in West Antarctica, an area with overall elevation much lower than East Antarctica. Beneath the ice much of the West Antarctic land mass is currently below sea level, pushed down by the thick overlying ice layer. Ice in this area is more susceptible to a warming ocean than ice in East Antarctica. If all of West Antarctica were to melt the sea level rise contribution would be ~6 meters (20 ft.). Thwaites glacier holds enough ice to add 2/3 of a meter of sea level rise (2 ft.), but if it collapsed it could release ice adding another 3 meters (10 ft.) of sea level rise.  All of Antarctica holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by 60 meters (200 ft.), but it is the Thwaites region in West Antarctica that is considered to be the most vulnerable.
