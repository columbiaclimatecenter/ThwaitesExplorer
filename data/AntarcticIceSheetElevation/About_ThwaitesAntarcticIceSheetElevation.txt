Antarctic Ice Sheet elevation: This elevation map divides Antarctica into contours using mostly 500  meter intervals.  The lowest contour,  0 to 100 meters (0-330 ft) of elevation, is the floating ice shelves that border much of Antarctica  (shown in yellow). The highest contour, 3500-4100 meters (11,500-13450 ft), is deep in the interior of East Antarctica (shown in white). The contours represent a combination of the underlying topography and the layer of thick ice that covers the 97% of Antarctica.

Ice in this area is more susceptible to a warming ocean than ice in East Antarctica. All of Antarctica holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by 60 meters (200 ft.), with the low lying West Antarctica able to contribute ~6 meters (20 ft.) of that. But it is the Thwaites region in West Antarctica that is considered to be the most vulnerable. Thwaites glacier alone holds enough ice to add 2/3 of a meter of sea level rise (2 ft.), but its collapse could release ice adding an overall 3 meters (10 ft.) of sea level rise.
