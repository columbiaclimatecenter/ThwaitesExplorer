Height of Antarctic ice: Both the elevation and volume of ice are important to long term ice stability. This map of Antarctica is divided into contours of elevation, shown mainly at 500 meter steps. The lowest elevation shown is for the floating ice shelves that extend off the ice sheet and border much of Antarctica. In the map it is yellow and sits at an elevation of 0 to 100 meters (0-330 ft). The highest elevation areas are 3500-4100 meters (11,500-13450 ft) and show as white deep in the interior of East Antarctica. The elevation contours include both the topography of the land below and the thick ice that covers 97% of the Antarctic continent.
