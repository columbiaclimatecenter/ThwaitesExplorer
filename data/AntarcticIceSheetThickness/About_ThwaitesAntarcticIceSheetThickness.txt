Thickness of Antarctic ice: This map shows Antarctic Ice Sheet thickness, measuring just the ice from its surface through to where it rests on the land at its base. In the map sections that are royal blue range from have an ice thickness of 500 meters or less. Areas that are red are covered in thick ice, up to 3500 meters or 3.5 kms of ice thickness. The majority of the thick ice is in East Antarctica, covering land that is resistant hard bedrock that sits up higher from the ocean than the land in West Antarctica.
