Antarctic Ice Sheet Thickness: This map shows Antarctic Ice Sheet thickness, measured from the ice surface through to the land surface below. Knowing the thickness of the ice is important for determining the total ice volume in the different regions of Antarctica, in assessing how much of the ice rests above or below sea level, and in calculating the steepness of the ice which affects how it moves and how quickly it flows. These calculations are all critical in providing a better understanding of potential future climatic impacts. Radar instruments on airplanes and satellites were used to collect thickness and ice internal structure measurements. Both ITGC modeling projects PROPHET and DOMINOS will incorporate data on ice thickness in their work.
