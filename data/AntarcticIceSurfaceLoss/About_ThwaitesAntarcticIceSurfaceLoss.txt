Antarctic ice surface elevation change: There are several ways that scientists measure changes in the amount of polar ice, each uses different satellites. Some measure ice thinning or loss of ice surface elevation, others the speed of ice flow or acceleration, and still others changes in size or overall ice weight or mass. This map of changes in surface elevation is shown in cm a year in block regions. The data was collected over a twelve year period (1992-2004) and highlight the importance of the ITGC work. Note the large red block outlining Thwaites glacier and the adjacent Pine Island glacier, highlighting this area as the largest fast changing region in Antarctica with annual surface elevation loss of 50 cm. Ice from this area drains into the Amundsen Sea contributing to sea level rise. Peach areas show annual loss of 25 cm and yellow is stable. Areas gaining annual elevation are 25 cm in light blue and 50 cm in dark blue. No data is available for dark gray areas, and light gray areas around the coast show ice shelves (thick area of floating ice still attached to the ice sheet on land).
