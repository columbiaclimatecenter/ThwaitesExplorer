Speed of ice flow: Glacial ice flows, tugged by gravity and moving under its own weight. This map of ice movement in Antarctica is a mosaic from satellite data collected from 2007-2009. In the map ice is moving at rates of meters a year, with blue areas moving slowly at just over a meter a year, while yellow, orange and red areas flowing up to 3000 meters are year.  The data show ice flow accelerating as it moves from the center of the ice sheet towards the continental edges where it moves out over the ocean. Thwaites surface ice speeds exceed 2000 meters a year (1.2 miles per year) near the area of its grounding line where it goes afloat.
