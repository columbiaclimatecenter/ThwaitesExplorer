Antarctic Ice Velocity: Glacial ice flows, tugged by gravity and moving under its own weight. This map of ice movement in Antarctica is a mosaic from satellite data collected from 2007-2009. The data show ice flow accelerating as it moves from the center of the ice sheet towards the continental edges where it moves out over the ocean. The fastest moving ice in Antarctica flows into the Amundsen Sea from the Thwaites Glacier and neighboring Pine Island Glacier. Thwaites glacier alone drains an area approximately the size of Britain or the state of Florida, accounting for approximately 4% of global sea level rise, an amount that has doubled since the mid-1990s. Why the ice moves so rapidly in the Thwaites region is under investigation by ITGC project teams, such as GHOST and TIME.
