Thwaites is losing ice mass: This map shows the overall loss of ice contained in the Antarctic ice sheet by measuring the change in total ice weight or mass from 2003-2014. Ice mass is one of several ways that scientists measure change in the amount of polar ice using different techniques and satellites. Others methods measure change in elevation of the ice surface, change in the speed of ice flow (i.e. acceleration), and retreat or pulling back of the ice edge. Click through the years and then on the map to see the changes in mass loss. You will need to touch on the map each year as the numeric values carry forward unless you refresh them.
