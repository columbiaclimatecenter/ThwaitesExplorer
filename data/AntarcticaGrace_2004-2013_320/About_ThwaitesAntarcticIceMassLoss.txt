Antarctic Ice Mass Loss: There are several ways that scientists measure changes in the amount of polar ice, each uses different techniques, including satellites. Some measure ice thinning or the change in elevation of the ice surface, others changes in the speed of ice flow (i.e. acceleration), while others detect changes in the total ice weight or mass. This step-through series shows mass changes in the Antarctic ice sheet for the decade 2004-2013. In the image peach, red and brown areas show ice loss and blue areas show ice gain. Clicking through the years highlights the significant ice loss in the Thwaites glacier region of West Antarctica. This loss has continued through to present day and is measured at close to 125 gigatons a year, causing sea level to rise by 0.35 mm/annually.
