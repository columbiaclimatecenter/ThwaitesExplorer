BAS airborne survey: At the start of the ITGC collaboration the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) committed to flying an aerosurvey to gather critical background data to support the ground teams in their field season. This map shows the flight paths of the UK National Capability aerosurvey flown by a joint BAS-LDEO team in January and February 2019. The team used a BAS Twin Otter equipped with ice-penetrating radar, a scanning laser, gravimeters, and magnetometers. Black lines show transit only with no data collection involved. The colored lines represent different flights. Click Audio for a short story guide as you explore the map. LISTEN AND EXPLORE TO LEARN MORE!
