Seafloor depths around Antarctica: Bathymetry is the depth of the ocean, equivalent to topography on land. The Southern Ocean bathymetry is of great importance for the modeling and understanding of pathways and barriers of deep oceanic heat to the ice sheet (see Ocean Temperatures at 550 m Map). The Amundsen Sea continental shelf is one of the most remote areas of coastal Antarctica and remained relatively unexplored until the late 1980s. The glaciers and ice streams that end in the Amundsen Sea, including Thwaites Glacier, are thinning faster than the rest of Antarctica. The current hypothesis relates this glacier change to warmer ocean water on the continental shelf, funneled by deep troughs under the ice shelves.
