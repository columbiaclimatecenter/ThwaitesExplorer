<h4>Summary</h4>
</p>
<p>
BedMachine is a new Antarctic bed topography product, also shown in "A Look Beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet" Map, that includes measurements of sea floor depth, called 'bathymetry'.
</p>

<p>
On the map shown here the deep blue and purple colors show areas that are very deep, mostly off the continental shelf in the ocean collected from
shipborne multi-beam sonar. Cyan and light blue colors are areas on the continental shelf and relatively deep channels under the ice,
continuing inland. Some of these inland channels reach over below sea level. Notice that the deep channels in the bed align with fast flowing ice in the velocity map in the Polar Explorer App.

The yellow and red colors show the shallowest bathymetry.

Researchers are interested in the shape, depths and pattern of bedrock underneath the ocean for many reasons.
As illustrated in the Ice Velocity layer in this App, ice flows downhill under its own weight. Deeper channels result in thicker ice and higher gravitational pull causing faster ice flow.
The geometry of the shape of the land under the ice determines how much interaction there is between the ocean, ice shelves and marine terminating glaciers.
If the flow of ice from the interior does not keep pace with melting at the grounding line, the ice sheet can retreat from its present day position.
Where the bed under the ice sheet deepens from the coast to the interior, the grounding line is considered unstable, and is able to retreat rapidly inland.
</p>

<p>
The shape, depth, and overall character of the bed reveal many things about the history of the ice sheets.
By looking at bathymetric features seaward of its present day glacial limit, we can learn about the ice sheet during previous glacial advances,
when the ice sheet was larger and extended further out.
Under the present day ice, where we find such recognizable terrestrial features as canyons, mountains, and terraces, lie clues to past interglacial
periods when there was much less ice in Antarctica than present day.
