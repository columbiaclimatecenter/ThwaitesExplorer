Look under the Antarctic Ice Sheet: This map of Antarctica has the ice removed so we can see what lies below the ice. Ice has covered Antarctica for at least the last 23 million years, so this map shows land elevation measurements that are hidden to the human eye. While it might seem odd to see land areas shown in blue, the color is used to represent land that has been pushed down so far by the weight of the ice that if the ice were removed it would be covered by the ocean water. Thwaites area is extremely vulnerable since the land behind the ice grounded line drops down deeply creating ‘Marine Ice Sheet Instability’.

This image highlights an important vulnerability for Thwaites referred to as Marine Ice Sheet Instability, when the land drops down allowing and warm ocean water to get under the ice sheet.(Holland et al., 2020)
