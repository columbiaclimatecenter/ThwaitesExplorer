Beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet: This map is of Antarctica without the ice. Ice has covered Antarctica for at least the last 23 million years so this map shows land elevation measurements that are hidden to human eyes. Ice sheets are thick and heavy, and over time Antarctica's ice sheet has pushed large areas of the continent crust below sea level. In this map brown and green represent land at and above sea level, while blue shades show land below sea level. Clicking on the map reveals elevations that range from almost 3000 meters above sea level in East Antarctica, to almost 2000 meters below sea level in areas of West Antarctica. The Thwaites Glacier sits in a very low elevation region making it especially vulnerable to destabilized retreat by warming ocean water. The ITGC projects TIME, GHOST, MELT, TARSAN and THOR will contribute data to improve our understanding of this vulnerability.
