<h4>Summary</h4>
</p>
<p>
Most of us would picture a large flat icy surface when we think of Antarctica, but the shape and elevation of the underlying land surface is varied and not flat. The depressions and features on the ice
are critically important to sea level rise.<hr>
<p>

<p>

Scientists have been studying a series of important questions about the relationship between the ice, the land underneath, and the ocean around Antarctica. These include:
How much of the ice is resting on the land above sea level and how much is on land below sea level? How stable is the 'grounding line', the place around the perimeter of the ice sheet where the ice starts to float?
How quickly can ice move from the land to the ocean? And is there a <a href="#crit" data-rel="popup">critical 'tipping point'</a>?

Underneath the seemingly tranquil ice covering Antarctica lies a complex and varied terrain which includes volcanoes,
large mountain ranges larger than New York state, deep trenches and old river valleys, and several hundred lakes including one the size of Lake Ontario.
Some of these landscape features predate the onset of Antarctica glaciation, some 34 million years ago, but most of the landscape has been molded and altered by the glacial cycles.
Features that are formed by ice are termed glacio-morphological. The age of the Antarctic ice sheet means the land has been worked and reworked by the ice through time, overprinting earlier landscape features.
The slow movement of thick ice carves deep U shaped features into the land as it moves. The influence of plate tectonics can also be seen in the Antarctic bedrock like scars left behind from the
breakup of the Gondwanan supercontinent. In Antarctica where these deep trenches exist they provide a way for
warming ocean water to move into the interior of the ice sheet, increasing ice melt. If the entire Antarctic ice sheet were to melt, it would be the equivalent of If the entire Antarctic ice sheet were to melt, it would be the equivalent of<a href="#metric" data-rel="popup">60 m</a> of sea level rise.

Although Antarctica is one continent it is made up of two different regions separated into West and East Antarctica by the Transantarctic Mountains.
West Antarctica, where we find the Antarctic Peninsula, is an ice covered archipelago. Ice in this area measures up to<a href="#metric1" data-rel="popup"> 2500 m</a> thick. Touching on the map in the app shows that
under the ice significant sections of the land in West Antarctica are up to <a href="#metric2" data-rel="popup">2000 m</a> below sea level. West Antarctica holds the equivalent of<a href="#metric3" data-rel="popup"> 6 m</a> of sea level rise.
East Antarctica is a much older and larger section of land. Ice in the East Antarctic interior measures up to <a href="#metric4" data-rel="popup">4100 m</a> thick and holds enough ice to raise sea level <a href="#metric5" data-rel="popup">55 m</a> considerably more than any other source on Earth.
The crust under East Antarctica is thicker than West Antarctica, and so the average elevation is higher,
although parts still reach below sea level. The weight of the ice sheet itself has pushed the crust down to
make it sit lower than it would in an ice free world, increasing the area where rock is below sea level.
These regions can be easily identified as <a href="#negative" data-rel="popup">below sea level</a> using the color scale in the Polar
Explorer App. If the ice sheet were to melt,
these depressed areas of land would elevate slowly over thousands of years as the weight is removed and the crust rebounds.
Presently, this same type of rebound is occurring in other parts of the earth where ice has receded.
It is most pronounced in the northern hemisphere in the Great Lakes and Canada's Hudson Bay regions and in Scandinavia,
where thousands of years have passed since they were covered by their own ice sheets, the Laurentide and Fennoscandia respectively.

BedMachine is a new Antarctic bed topography product based on ice thickness data from 19 different research institutes dating back to 1967, encompassing nearly a million line-miles of radar soundings. BedMachine relies on the fundamental physics-based method of mass conservation to estimate what lies between the radar sounding lines, utilizing highly detailed information on ice flow motion from satellite data that dictates how ice moves. The dataset is available from the National Snow & Ice Data Center here.

On the map shown here the deep blue and purple colors show areas that are very deep, mostly off the continental shelf in the ocean collected from
shipborne multi-beam sonar. Cyan and light blue colors are areas on the continental shelf and relatively deep channels under the ice,
continuing inland from the <a href="#grounding" data-rel="popup">grounding lines</a>. Some of these inland channels reach over <a href="#metric6" data-rel="popup">2000 m</a> below sea level.
The yellow and red colors show the highest topography. These can be either large mountain ranges hidden for millions of years under several miles of ice, such as the Gamburtsev Mountains in the radar image below,
or a ridgeline of mountains exposed above the ice, such as the Trans Antarctic Mountains.
Notice that the deep channels in the bed align with fast flowing ice in the velocity map in the Polar Explorer App.

Researchers are interested in the shape, depths and pattern of bedrock underneath the ice sheet for many reasons.
As illustrated in the Ice Velocity layer in this App, ice flows downhill under its own weight. Deeper channels result in thicker ice and higher gravitational pull causing faster ice flow.
The geometry of the shape of the land under the ice determines how much interaction there is between the ocean, ice shelves and marine terminating glaciers.
If the flow of ice from the interior does not keep pace with melting at the grounding line, the ice sheet can retreat from its present day position.
Where the bed under the ice sheet deepens from the coast to the interior, the grounding line is considered unstable, and is able to retreat rapidly inland.
</p>

<p>
The shape, depth, and overall character of the bed reveal many things about the history of the ice sheets.
By looking at bathymetric features seaward of its present day glacial limit, we can learn about the ice sheet during previous glacial advances,
when the ice sheet was larger and extended further out.
Under the present day ice, where we find such recognizable terrestrial features as canyons, mountains, and terraces, lie clues to past interglacial
periods when there was much less ice in Antarctica than present day.
