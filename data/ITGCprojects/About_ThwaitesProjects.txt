ITGC projects: The Thwaites collaboration is a partnership between the largest science funding agencies of the United Kingdom and the United Stated to study one of the most unstable glaciers in Antarctica. Over a five year period from 2018-2022 more than 60 scientists and students in 8 different projects (6 field projects and 2 modeling projects) are exploring Thwaites Glacier, and the wider Thwaites catchment, from the ocean and marine sediments to currents flowing toward the deep ice, and examine the stretching, bending, and grinding of the glacier over the landscape below. In the map the ITGC the six field projects are shown as red solid circles located in their principle geographic area of focus. The two modeling projects are shown as open circles.
