The International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration projects: The Thwaites collaboration is a partnership between the largest science funding agencies of the United Kingdom and the United Stated to study one of the most unstable glaciers in Antarctica. Over a five year period from 2018-2022 more than 60 scientists and students in 8 different projects (6 field projects and 2 modeling projects) will explore Thwaites from the ocean and marine sediments to currents flowing toward the deep ice, and examine the stretching, bending, and grinding of the glacier over the landscape below.

In the map the ITGC the six field projects are shown as red solid circles located in their principle geographic area of focus. The two modeling projects are shown as open circles.
- TIME is a study of how the boundary of the glacier evolves, and the differences between the slow-moving ice and underlying rock outside the glacier versus the interior.
- GHOST is a traverse of the core of the glacier, looking at ice and bedrock characteristics with seismic and radar data.
- GHC will collect rock samples from either side of Thwaites Glacier to look for clues as to its recent past history.
- THOR will also look for clues to the glaciers past history using marine sediments, bathymetric mapping, and oceanography.
- MELT and TARSAN both have a focus on the ice-ocean interaction at the point of contact between land, ice, and sea, looking at ocean circulation and rates of ice melt near the front of the glacier.
- PROPHET and DOMINOS are the two modeling studies that will integrate the findings of the field programs into models that will allow us to apply the past and present into planning for our future.
