Ice Sheet Fingerprinting: This two map set is a different orientation, using a broad worldview rather than focusing only on Antarctica. The maps show the relative affect of sea level changes that would result from the melting of each of the two remaining ice sheets, Antarctica and Greenland. The area of impact from each ice sheet is referred to as a \'91Fingerprint\'92. These maps might seem surprising since sea level does not change uniformly, and actually falls near the ice sheet experiencing the ice loss. This is explained by gravity. Ice sheets have a gravitational attraction, a result of the large amount of ice, effectively an ice mountain. This ice mountain pulls ocean water towards it, stacking up water near the coast and elevating regional sea level. If large sections of the ice sheet melt the attraction will reduce causing nearby sea level to drop and sending that water to another area. These maps show a modeled fingerprint effect for each ice sheet. The red identifies areas where we would expect to see sea level rise and blue where sea level fall.
