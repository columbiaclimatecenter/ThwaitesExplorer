Ice Sheet Fingerprinting: In the maps, land is shown in grey with the Antarctic continent stretched out across the bottom of the map. Thwaites Glacier sits just to the left of where the West Antarctic Peninsula reaches up towards South America. The ocean is shown in the maps in colors representing the relative affect of sea level changes that would result from the melting of each of the two remaining ice sheets. The 'Northern Source' is ice melt from Greenland and the 'Southern Source'  is ice melt from Antarctica. 

The area of impact from each ice sheet is referred to as a 'Fingerprint'. These maps might seem surprising since sea level does not change uniformly, and actually falls near the ice sheet experiencing the ice loss. This is explained by gravity. Ice sheets have a gravitational attraction, a result of the large amount of ice, effectively an ice mountain. This ice mountain pulls ocean water towards it, stacking up water near the coast and elevating regional sea level. If large sections of the ice sheet melt the attraction will reduce causing nearby sea level to drop and sending that water to another area. These maps show a modeled fingerprint effect for each ice sheet. The red identifies areas where we would expect to see sea level rise and blue where sea level fall.
