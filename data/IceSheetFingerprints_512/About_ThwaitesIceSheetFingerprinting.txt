Fingerprints from melting ice sheets: ‘Fingerprinting’ from a melting ice sheet may seem like an unusual concept, but it means that each ice sheet, when melted, will have an area of influence or impact, or a fingerprint. This display has two maps, one showing the area of influence for the Antarctic ice sheet (Southern source) and one for the Greenland ice sheet (Northern Source). In the maps, land is shown in grey with the Antarctic continent stretched out across the bottom of the map. Thwaites Glacier sits just to the left of where the West Antarctic Peninsula reaches up towards South America. The ocean is shown in the maps in colors representing the relative affect of sea level changes that would result from the melting of each of the two remaining ice sheets.
