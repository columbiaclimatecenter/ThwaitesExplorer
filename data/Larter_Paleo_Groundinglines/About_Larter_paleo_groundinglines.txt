Paleo Grounding Lines: The map shows the extent of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet over the last 20,000 (20 ka) years for the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas region. The ice edge is mapped in 5000 year steps from 20 ka (20,000) to 5 ka before present. The lines represent the ice grounding line, the location where ice transitions from resting on the land below, to detaching to go afloat as ice shelves. Grounding lines are an important measure of ice sheet size are is critical for determining ice sheet stability.  20 ka ago was the Last Glacial Maximum, and ice in this region reached to the edge of the continental shelf. Since that time it has retreated, with evidence that 10 ka ago it was close to present day's extent before expanding slightly in this region around 5 ka.
