20,000 years of ice sheet history: This map is a regional look at the extent of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet over the last 20,000 (20 ka) years focusing on the Amundsen (south) and Bellingshausen (north) Seas region. The ice edge is mapped in 5000 year steps going back to 20 ka ago moving through to 5 ka before present. The lines represent the ice grounding line, the location where ice transitions from resting on the land below, to detaching to go afloat as ice shelves. Between 10Ka and 5 Ka the grounding line location appears to retreat and re-expand, possibly due to the reduction in ice load allowing the land surface to rebound and the ice expand. Clicking anywhere along the lines makes the dates appear, and click Audio for a short story guide as you explore the map. LISTEN AND EXPLORE TO LEARN MORE!
