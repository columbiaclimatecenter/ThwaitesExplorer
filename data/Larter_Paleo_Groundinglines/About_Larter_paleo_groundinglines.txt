The map shows the extent of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet over the last 20,000 years for the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas region. The ice edge is mapped in 5000 year steps from 20 ka to 5 ka before present. The lines represent the ice grounding line, the location where ice transitions from resting on the land below, to detaching to go float as ice shelves. Grounding lines are an important measure of ice sheet size and is critical for determining ice sheet stability.  20 ka ago was the Last Glacial Maximum, with ice in this region reaching to the edge of the continental shelf. Since that time it has retreated, with evidence that 10 ka ago it was close to present day's extent before expanding slightly in this region around 5 ka before present.
