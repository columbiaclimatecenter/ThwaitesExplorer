NSF Ship Survey: Under the direction of chief scientist Rob Larter (BAS), the Research Vessel IceBreaker (RVIB) Nathanial B. Palmer (NBP) departed for Thwaites Glacier from Punta Arena, Chile on 2019-01-29, with stops at additional research sites and stations (e.g. BAS-Rothera) along the way.  Overall, 34 days were allocated for science activities within the 52 day cruise.

In broad terms the activities were physical oceanography (TARSAN), marine geology and geophysics (THOR) and terrestrial geology and geomorphology (GHC). After servicing and deploying ocean moorings, two autonomous underwater vehicle missions, satellite tags placed on 11 seals, collecting data on bathymetry, gravity, local meteorology, and temperature and conductivity of the full water column, the research cruise returned to Punta Arenas on 2019-03-25.
