NBP ship surveys: Under the direction of chief scientist Rob Larter (BAS), the Research Vessel IceBreaker (RVIB) Nathanial B. Palmer (NBP) departed for Thwaites Glacier from Punta Arena, Chile on 2019-01-29 and a return to Punta Arenas on 2019-03-25.  Along with attaining their final destination in Amundsen Bay front of Thwaites Glacier, the research cruise made stops at additional research sites and stations (e.g. BAS-Rothera) along the way. Overall, 34 days were allocated for science activities within the 52 day cruise focusing on data collection for three of the ITGC projects TARSAN, THOR and GHC. (Note: Ice outside the marked ice margin is composed of floating sea ice and icebergs. The ship tracks and ice data are from different time periods, meaning there exists some false overlap of a ship's path with both ice shelves and icebergs.)
