Sea Ice Concentration: Ice in the polar regions comes in several different forms, but the two main distinctions are 1) land ice and 2) sea ice. Glaciers are examples of 'land ice', ice consisting of compressed snow that sits on land. When land ice melts it contributes directly to sea level rise when it hits the ocean. 'Sea ice' is created on the ocean surface, when air and water temperatures cool enough to freeze the ocean water. Sea ice also performs critical protection for the Antarctic ice Sheet helping to buffer it from wave activity, warmer air, and providing a bright white surface that reflects sunlight. Antarctic sea ice undergoes large seasonal and regional variability. You can step through the months to watch the sea ice grow through September (the Antarctic winter) and then shrink throughout summer until March when temperatures start to cool.

Different from the Arctic where sea ice is overall in decline, Antarctica sea ice is increasing in some areas and decreasing in others. In the region of the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea, the story is mixed. Consistent sea ice cover loss from 1979-2010 has reversed the last decade with sea ice in an upward trend.
