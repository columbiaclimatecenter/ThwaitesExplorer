Sea Ice Concentration: Ice in the polar regions comes in several different forms, but two main divisions are land ice and sea ice. Land ice forms on land sitting up out of the water, and when it melts contributes directly to sea level rise when it hits the ocean. Sea ice is created in the ocean, when air and water temperatures cool enough to freeze the surface. Sea ice does performs critical protections for the Antarctic ice Sheet helping to buffer it from wave activity, warmer surface water and air, and providing a reflective white surface that sends heat energy back into space cooling the region. Antarctic sea ice undergoes large seasonal and regional variability.  Different from the Arctic where sea ice is overall in decline, Antarctica sea ice is increasing in some areas and decreasing in others. In the region of the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea the story is mixed. Consistent sea ice cover loss from 1979-2010 has reversed the last decade with sea ice in an upward trend. You can step through the months to watch the sea ice grow through September in the Antarctic winter and then shrink in the summer until February/March when temperatures cool.
