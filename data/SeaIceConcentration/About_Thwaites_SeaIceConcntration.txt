Monthly sea ice concentrations: Ice in the polar regions exists as several different types, but two main divisions are land ice and sea ice. Land ice forms from snow falling on the land surface where it collects up out of the water. When land ice melts, or if sections of it flow into the ocean, it contributes directly to sea level rise. Sea ice is created in the ocean, when air and water temperatures cool enough to freeze the water surface. Sea Ice varies throughout the year, and you can step through the months to watch the sea ice grow through September in the Antarctic winter and then shrink in the summer until February/March when temperatures cool. Since sea ice already rests in the ocean the melt associated with its annual shrinking does not contribute directly to sea level rise. However, sea ice does perform a major role in stabilizing the Antarctic ice Sheet.
