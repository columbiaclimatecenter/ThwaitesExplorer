Tide stations recording rising and falling: shows regional trends in sea level change using tide gauges placed around the world, including 2 on the Antarctic Peninsula. Sea level is the result of a combination or factors but the two main are the amount of heat in the water (warm water expands and takes up more space), and the amount of water that is frozen in land based ice versus the amount that is liquid in the oceans and supporting water bodies. On the map the color of the dot represents both the amount and direction of sea level change. In the map green, yellow, orange and red dot colors show rising sea level, and purple, black to brown show falling sea level. Globally sea level is rising at ~ 3.2 mm/year.
