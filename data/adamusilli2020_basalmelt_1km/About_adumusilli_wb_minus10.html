Thwaites ice shelf is melting from below: This map focuses on the very edges of the Antarctic ice sheet, where the ice has gone afloat, areas called ice shelves. The shelves are thick and remain attached to the coastline. They exist along much of the Antarctic coast where they hold back the massive amount of ice that is sitting on bedrock. Since the ice shelves float in the ocean they are vulnerable to water melting them from below.

Caption: A new ITGC study (Wahlan et al, 2021) adds new data from an AUV ‘Ran’ diving under the ice shelf collecting information on water temperatures, water pathways, and circulation under the ice shelf. The image shows suggested pathways and mixing area of the water underneath Thwaites ice tongue and Eastern Ice Shelf and an unexpected deep pathway from Pine Island Basin.
