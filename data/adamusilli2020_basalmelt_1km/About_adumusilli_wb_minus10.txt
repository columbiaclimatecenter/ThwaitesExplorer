Thwaites is melting from below: Ice shelves are the floating edges of the ice sheet where glaciers flow from land into the ocean. The shelves remain attached to the coastline, and exist along much of the Antarctic coast where they hold back thicker ice that is sitting on bedrock. In this map of Antarcticaâ€™s ice shelves they might look small in scale compared to the ice sheet, but their role in keeping the ice sheet stable is significant. These floating ice shelves (50-1000 meters thick) have helped to keep ice sheets stable for thousands of years. However, research shows warm ocean currents have been melting ice shelves from below. For the last 25 years, ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (which includes Thwaites Glacier) have average melt rates of up to 10 meters a year.
