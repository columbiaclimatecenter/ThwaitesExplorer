Thwaites is thinning: There are several ways scientists measure change in the amount of polar ice, each uses different satellites. This map is of annual change in ice thickness is shown in meters of ice surface elevation from 2003-2019. It is collected from NASA ICESat 1 and ICESat 2 using laser altimetry, a method that sends out and re-collects a short laser pulse to measure surface ice with elevations determined within a meter. These measurements highlight the importance of understanding what is driving the changes in ice loss in the Thwaites Glacier region.
