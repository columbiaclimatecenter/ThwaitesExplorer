ICESat thinning rates: There are several ways that scientists measure changes in the amount of polar ice, each uses different satellites. This map is of change in ice thickness, collected using laser altimetry and shown here as meters of ice loss per year. Data were collected by NASA ICESat 1 and ICESat 2 over the sixteen year period of 2003-2019. They highlight the importance of the ITGC work. The largest area of ice thinning is in the Amundsen Sea region (which includes Thwaites glacier and the adjacent Pine Island glacier). This is an area of significant change with some glaciers thinning at over 10 meters per year. Areas gaining elevation are shown in blue. The declination of the satellites results in no data in a hole around the South Pole.
