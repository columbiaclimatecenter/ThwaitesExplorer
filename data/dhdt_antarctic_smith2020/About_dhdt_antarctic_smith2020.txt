ICESat thinning rates: There are several ways that scientists measure changes in the amount of polar ice, each uses different satellites. Some measure ice thinning or loss of ice surface elevation, others the speed of ice flow or acceleration, and still others changes in size or overall ice weight or mass. This map is of change in ice thickness, collected using laser altimetry and shown here as meters of ice loss per year. Data were collected by NASA ICESat 1 and ICESat 2 over the sixteen year period of 2003-2019. They highlight the importance of the ITGC work. The single largest area of ice loss is in the Amundsen Sea region that includes Thwaites glacier and the adjacent Pine Island glacier. This is an area of significant change with some sections measured with as much as 10 meters of loss. Areas gaining elevation are shown in blue. No data were available for the gray circular section around the South Pole.
