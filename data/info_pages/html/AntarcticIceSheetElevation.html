<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
Ice sheet elevation is a measurement that is necessary for calculating overall ice accumulation through time. 
Both the total amount of ice, and where it has accumulated over time are important in understanding potential future impacts of the ice sheet.

One global change in sea level is the transfer of water between frozen ice sheets and liquid oceans that occurs as the Earth's climate moves through large-scale cooling and warming events. 
Ice elevation, the measure of ice thickness, is a necessary figure in calculating any changes in the ice sheets and subsequent sea level rise.  
It is determined by finding the base of the ice on the underlying topography, and then measuring the height of the ice in the ice sheet above that point. 
Knowing the ice elevation is a 'boundary condition', or a controlling parameter, for developing models of how we
expect the ice sheet to behave with changes in climate. The total amount of ice in the ice sheet, and where it has accumulated over time, are both important in 
understanding potential future impacts of the ice sheet.

The Earth's tilted rotation, and Antarctica's position on the bottom, means that for much of the year Antarctica receives significantly less heat and energy from the sun than areas in the mid-latitudes. 
Approximately 35-40 million years ago Drake's Passage opened separating Antarctica from South America, and causing a change in ocean and atmospheric circulation around Antarctica that 
has kept the continent mainly isolated from the rest of the world.  
The result of these physical changes (the establishment of the strong circular currents in the Southern Ocean and the strong air patterns in the Polar Front) 
has resulted in somewhat of a temperature isolation of Antarctica. Snow collected, pressing into permanent ice, and through time formed the very 
thick and very old ice sheet now covering Antarctica. In the interior regions ice measures more than 4000 meters (about 2.5 miles) in depth. 
Overall, the land mass is 98% covered with 27 million km3 of ice. If fully melted, there would be a rise in sea level of close to 60 meters (200 ft).

The map in the app divides the ice into contours of ice thickness. Clicking on each contour brings up the thickness of the ice in meters. 
Although Antarctica is one continent, it is made up of two different regions separated into West and East Antarctica by the Transantarctic Mountains. In the app you can 
see the separation in the narrowing between the peninsula shape of West Antarctica, and the larger more oval shaped land mass of East Antarctica. 
West Antarctica is an ice covered archipelago with ice measuring up to 2500 meters (1.5 miles) thick. You can look back at the map layer that looks under the Antarctic ice sheet, or 
you can use the slider bar on the bottom left of this page to remove the overlying ice image to see how much of the West Antarctica land is below sea level. (Note that when you use the slider to remove the overlying map the touch based measurements remain 
linked to the map layer, not to the base map underneath.) If the West Antarctic ice sheet were to melt the sea level rise contribution would be ~6 meters (20 ft.). This is because much of this ice is already 
below sea level, resting in the ocean. East Antarctica, a much older and larger section of land and ice, has ice thicker than 4000 meters (2.5 miles) in the interior. Although sections 
of East Antarctica are also below sea level, there is enough ice stacked on land that were it to melt, sea level would rise 55 meters (180 ft); this is considerably more than any other source on Earth.

Measurements of ice thickness in the app are collected from the Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) and include high-resolution radarsat data and topographic data 
from a number of sources to get full coverage of the area. Data for this map has been collected from the 1940s to present, most of it from 1980 forward. Radar measures total ice thickness from the surface to 
the base of the ice, as well as information on the different internal layers of ice thickness. Radar operates by sending pulses of radio waves and measuring and timing the delay between transmission and reception of a pulse through the ice.
The size and remoteness of Antarctica makes data collection challenging. Satellite data combined with airborne data continues to improve our understanding of ice thickness in Antarctica.
