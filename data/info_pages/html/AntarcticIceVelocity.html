<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
Glacial ice is in constant motion, whether at a rate of cms or meters or even kms a year. 
It is important to monitor the velocity of glacial sliding in order to determine the amount of ice being added into the ocean and contributing to sea level rise.

Although it may appear stationary, glacial ice is constantly moving, flowing downslope under its own weight. 
The velocity of the ice refers to how quickly it moves its position and is governed by the difference in driving and resistive forces. 
The 'driving force' in glaciers is gravity, which increases with steeper surface slopes and thicker ice causing the ice to flow faster. 
Most of the resistive forces comes from friction between the ice and the surrounding rock; friction from narrow channels and rough bedrock 
will decrease glacier speed. Temperature is another major factor in the speed of a glacier. A temperate glacier has a wet base that acts as a lubricant and increases glacial sliding.  
A cold based glacier on the other hand, is frozen at its base which increases friction and reduces ice speeds.
</p>


<p>
Scientist use many techniques to determine the speed of the ice surface. 
Historically these included, stakes placed in the ice and tracked manually, using aerial photographic differencing, and using high-precision GPS receivers to show change in location. 
Some of the best spatial coverage of ice surface velocity comes from satellite measurements, using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR), which can provide monthly ice surface velocity data at <a href="#metric" data-rel="popup">500 m</a> horizontal resolution. 
The digital mosaic image of Antarctic ice flow speed shown here and in the app is assembled from multiple InSAR data collected from 2007-2009 during the International Polar Year. 
The International Polar Year is a one to two year period in which many nations coordinate their Polar expeditions, observations and analyses in order to expand the effectiveness of their research. 

The InSAR data was complied by E. Rignot et al., and has been illustrated by M. Wolovick. 
Similar to radar used in weather monitoring and in traffic enforcement, electromagnetic energy is bounced off the Earthâ€™s surface and timed. 
The distance to the reflecting surface can be calculated by knowing the speed of light in the transmitting medium and the signal delay. 
By comparing data collected from different times, scientists can measure how much the ice surface has <a href="#movement" data-rel="popup">moved</a>
to determine its velocity.  However, these techniques only measure the velocity of the ice surface. Ice is like a very thick molasses 
in its movement, meaning the base of the ice moves more slowly due to friction between the ice and the bed beneath.

Zoom in on Antarctica using the app. The blue areas in the interior of the ice sheet are flowing slowly, many of them just a meter a year.  
These are primarily areas near the ice sheet summit and ice divides. Here the temperatures are very cold, and the ice surface is vast and flat. 
The very small amount of surface slope provides little driving stress. 
The red and yellow colors show the fastest moving ice. These areas are concentrated around the coast in the ice shelves and ice streams. Ice shelves are the floating edges of the ice sheet where it has 
moved off the land and into the ocean, ice streams are bands of fast flow within an ice sheet.  
Deep channels in the bed under the glaciers increase driving stress and reduce friction under the ice shelves, resulting in fast flowing ice. 
The two glaciers showing the fastest moving ice are Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers on the West Antarctic coast flowing into the Amundsen Bay. Each of these is flowing over <a href="#metric1" data-rel="popup">3000 m/year</a> at their <a href="#ground" data-rel="popup">'grounding line'</a>.
Glacier velocities change over both long and short timescales, the map data in the PolarExplorer App is a composite that is representative of 2007-2009. 
</p>
<p>
A rise in atmospheric and oceanic temperatures around Antarctica will act to increase the speed of the Antarctica ice sheet by several different mechanisms. 
Increased ocean temperature will increase melt at the base of marine terminating glaciers that empty into the ocean. Ocean water moves under the floating ice 'tongues' of these marine glaciers and attacks them where they are frozen to the land below (called the 'grounding line').

<p>

Melting back the grounding line will decrease resistance to flow and increase ice discharge. Faster ice, without an increase in snow accumulation high up on the ice sheet, results in a net increase of water input into 
the oceans, raising global sea level. With <a href="#metric2" data-rel="popup">~6 m</a> of potential global sea level rise in the West Antarctic ice sheet, and another <a href="#metric3" data-rel="popup">~55 m</a> in the more stable East Antarctic ice sheet, monitoring Antarctic ice velocity 
is critically important. Increased melting from ocean warming also weakens the ice shelves around Antarctica, causing them to calve and ultimately collapse. Ice shelves act like a gate to slow and hold the ice flowing 
onto the shelf from the glaciers. As ice shelves collapse, glacial ice accelerates moving more ice off the land and into the ocean. We have seen this occur along the Eastern side of the West Antarctic Peninsula with the Larsen ice shelves 'A' (1995) and 'B' (2002).
