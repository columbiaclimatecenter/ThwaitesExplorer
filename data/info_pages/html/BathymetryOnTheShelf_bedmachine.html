<h4>Summary</h4>
</p>
<p>
<a href="#depth" data-rel="popup">Bathymetry</a> is a measure of the depths of the seafloor in an area. In this map we focus on just one part of the seafloor, the shallow edge bordering the Antarctic continent called the <a href="#shelf" data-rel="popup">continental shelf</a>. 
The surface contours of this area are extremely important since depressions and troughs carved into the seafloor provide pathways for warm water to move across the shelf and into contact with the ice.
Even more critical in Antarctica are connected channels in the shelf that can collect and move warm ocean water across to the ice edge, and in some instances under the edge of the ice sheet. 
Exploring the seafloor allows us to locate where the Antarctic ice sheet is most vulnerable to impacts from a warming ocean.

<b>What is bathymetry?</b> Bathymetry is the measure of the depth of the seafloor. 
For much of human history people believed that the bottom of the ocean was featureless and smooth like a bathtub. 
Seafloor mapping began in the early 1840s driven by a curiosity for better understanding the ocean, an interest in dredging resources from the 
bottom of the ocean, and the beginning of telegraphic communications with the desire to lay large cables of wiring on the ocean floor. Understanding the shape of the 
ocean floor, its channels and ridges, has helped us to understand both ocean circulation patterns and sea-level changes.

Early mapping techniques were very simple with depth 
measurements collected by dropping a weighted line over the edge of a ship (first hemp rope and then piano wire). When the lead weight reached the bottom the line was measured and the depth of that individual spot was recorded. 
This technique had obvious limits, can you name a few? However, given its limitations it might surprise you to learn that they did manage to identify some important features in our ocean, such as a high ridgeline that was later 
identified as the <a href="#Mid" data-rel="popup">Mid Ocean Ridge</a>. 
They also located a point in the <a href="#trench" data-rel="popup">Mariana Trench</a>, measuring it at a depth of ~8000 meters (26,000 ft). While this is short of its deepest 
11,034 meters (36,201 ft) depth, imagine how much rope their measurement required the ship to carry! In the 1940s, the invention of echo sounding launched modern oceanography and a new time seafloor mapping using acoustics! Scientists measured the time required to send and receive sound waves sent 
through the water. Sampling techniques included tossing sticks of lit dynamite over the edge of the boat where it exploded, the use of hydrophones to listen for the sound to return, and submarines using an acoustic transducer underwater to send and receive sound. 
Today ships use multi-beam sonar mapping to map large sections of ocean floor. This technique can include hundreds of beams sent out like a fan collecting sonar data over a wide area.

<p>
<b>Why focus on the continental shelf?</b> In this map we focus just on the continental shelf, and do not include data from the deeper ocean or from inland of the ice sheet <a href="#grounding" data-rel="popup">grounding line</a>, an area currently covered by the ice sheet. 
The continental shelf is a shallow terrace hugging the edge of the continent (see image), and representing ~8% of the area covered by the world's ocean. They are not considered part of the deep ocean, instead they are the flooded edges of the continents. 
In most areas of the world they are less than 100-200 meters (330-660 ft.) below sea level and have an average width of 65-80 kms (40 to 50 miles). 
</p>
<p>
It is interesting to consider that during Earth's cold glacial periods sea levels around the world dropped, as more water froze into ice and the ocean shrank. At that time continental shelves were generally above sea level, 
either visible as exposed land or buried under an adjacent glacier or ice sheet. 
In Antarctica scientific evidence indicates that 25,000 years ago the Antarctic ice sheet was larger, completely covering the continental shelf.  
Ice sheets are heavy, pushing the Earth down under their weight. The weight of Antarctica's ice sheet continues to push the land down, including the continental shelf 
so that it sits at depths averaging 400-500 meters (1300-1650 ft.) below sea level. Across the shelf there are troughs carved 
as deep as 2000 meters in spots! 
</p>
<p>
<b>Why is the Thwaites Region so important to study?</b> In the ocean differences in temperature and salinity creates different density layers or water.
The top layer of ocean surface water around Antarctica is dominated by cold fresh meltwater from the ice. 
Layered beneath this few hundred meters (500-600 ft) of colder surface water is a mixture of warmer salty water. 
This ~1-2°C (34-36°F) water comes from a water mass called the <a href="#CDW" data-rel="popup">Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW)</a> circulating around Antarctica as part 
of the large <a href="#ACC" data-rel="popup">Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)</a>. 
In many areas around Antarctica the continental shelf is a barrier that keeps the warm CDW from getting access to the <a href="#shelves" data-rel="popup">ice shelves</a> that fringe the continent.

	</div>	
	</figure>
<p>
However, in the Amundsen Sea region when the CDW reaches the edge of the continental shelf it sits high enough that it remains above the <a href="#break" data-rel="popup">shelf break</a>. 
This allows the warm water to move onto the shelf, mixing with the colder fresher shelf water as it moves across towards the <a href="#sheets" data-rel="popup">ice sheet</a>, but only reducing its temperature 
by half a degree. See the graph inset of temperature and salinity showing the cold water on top and the effect of the CDW below it from this area!
On the continental shelf cold freshwater dominates.  Additionally, several deep glacially carved troughs in the shelf provide critical pathways for mainly unmixed, warm, dense CDW to flow up to, and under the ice shelves. There they cause increased melting and weakening of the ice. 
In places where the topography drops down deep under the ice, as the grounding line melts back CDW can actually make its way back under the land ice warming the ice at the base and causing increased melting and possible collapse. 
This is one of the reasons why Thwaites glacier is called a <a href="#threshold" data-rel="popup">threshold glacier</a>. Once destabilized it will fall apart and accelerate further collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet.
To explore further the pathways that CDW can use to move way back under the ice sheet, use the map <b>Look Under the Antarctic Ice Sheet</b> focusing on land based topography.

<b>How can we use the app?</b> If you zoom out on the map you will see that there are other areas around Antarctica that have continental shelf measurements that are 
deep, even deeper than the areas around Thwaites. We have placed a section of the map on this page identifying in counter clockwise order the Ronne Filchner, Pine Island, Thwaites and Ross ice shelves. 
You can see that in Ronne Filchner and Ross, the two largest ice shelves, there are some very deep areas. Ronne Filchner looks especially concerning. So why focus on Thwaites? 
In your exploration of this map you will want to remember that: (1) The top few hundred meters of water on the shelf are cooler and fresher due to ice melt. The warmer CDW moves in from 
the ocean and is denser due to higher salt content. In most areas around Antarctica the warmer CDW reaches the land below the shelf break and sits deep enough in the water column that it does not make it up onto the shelf. This is true for the 
Ronne Filcher and the Ross. Do you remember if this is true for the Amundsen Sea area where Pine Island and Thwaites sit? (2) Scientists worry about pathways in channels or troughs that allow dense CDW to move from the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica across the continental shelf and up to the and under the ice where its temperature will melt and erode the ice.

As you explore the map look at the continental shelf by Ronne Filchner. See how far back the deep areas are from the ice shelf edge? Can you find any pathways to bring deep warmer CDW from the ocean into the deep interior channels? 
What about Ross? Now look at Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers. Recall that, unlike other areas around Antarctica, the CDW already gets up on the continental shelf here. Hunt for channels and troughs to move the warm water in under the ice shelves. 
Can you find any pathways? At one time Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers flowed together as one large glacier. Now see if you can locate the separate channels. 
</p>
<p>
Locate the <b>Thor</b> project on the interactive map page. 
<b>Thor</b> is a ship based project that is looking for pathways that warm CDW water could take to move up under the ice. 
Move to the <b>Ocean Temperatures at 550 m</b> map and look at water temperatures around Ronne Filchner and Ross. Compare them to water temperatures around Pine Island and Thwaites. Do the ocean 
temperatures provide evidence of warm CDW making it up onto the continental shelf around Thwaites? Pine Island glacier is on one side of Thwaites and Crosson and Dotson on the other side. Scientists 
from the <b>THOR</b> and <b>Tarsan</b> projects are studying the area in front of Pine Island Glacier along with Thwiates, and the <b>Tarsan</b> team has 
also been looking at the Crosson/Dotson area. Can you locate any troughs in the Crosson/Dotson area?

<b>How was the data collected?</b> The map of the Antarctic continental shelf bathymetry was created using different methods/instruments that allowed imaging through 
the water to determine the bathymetry under the ocean.
In the ocean multi-beam echo-sounders, a type of sonar, is used to map details of the continental shelf and around the ice sheets. 
As part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) <b>THOR</b> project, multibeam sonar was collected from the Nathaniel B. Palmer along the continental shelf in the Amundsen Sea. 
This multibeam system uses over 400 different beams of sonar to get a wide sweep of data to create an image of the bottom of the sea floor with 25-50 meter (82-164 ft.) resolution. 
However, much of Antarctica's coastline includes extensive ice shelves, areas where the front edge of the ice sheet has gone afloat. 
To map the area under the large sections of attached ice is challenging as ship sonar can't access it and radar, often used to collect ice shelf thickness measurements, can't image through water to get depths.
Traditionally, <a href="#gravity" data-rel="popup">gravity</a> has been used in these inaccessible areas, and this map does include gravity measurements. Where the gravity is higher a ridge would be charted, where it is lower a trough or depression would be charted. However, the ITGC has projects that include new methods for 
collecting depth measurements under the floating ice, a submarine style robot and a diving glider. These different instruments can dive close to the 
bottom of the ocean and so can collect data at very high resolution of up to 1 meter (3 ft)! Each new measurement will
give us new information about the <a href="#depth" data-rel="popup">bathymetry</a> under the ice shelf. With very high resolution data available from these 
new instruments, what do you think is the value of the ship based measurements using multibeam sonar in this project?
