<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
Scientists are using a range of methods to monitor the Antarctic ice sheet, to tell us how the ice sheet is 
responding to climate change and assist us in predicting rates of sea level change. Data collected tells us that West Antarctica 
is currently not stable, it is thinning. One of the fastest changing areas of the Antarctic ice sheet is the Antarctic Peninsula and 
that section of West Antarctica bordering the Amundsen Sea.</p>

<p>
The ice cover on Antarctica is both old and thick. For some 34 million years Antarctica has been collecting snow, pressing it into ice until in the interior regions ice measures more than <a href="#meters" data-rel="popup">4000 meters</a>  in depth. 
The continent is the size of the U.S. and Mexico combined and is over 99.5% ice covered. Antarctica is the largest reservoir of ice on earth, holding enough ice that were it to fully melt, sea level would rise by <a href="#meters1" data-rel="popup">~60 meters</a> . 
</p>
<p>
Scientists are monitoring the Antarctic ice sheet by measuring changes in ice surface elevation, changes in ice speed, surface melt and overall ice mass . 
Each of these measurements can help tell us how the ice sheet is responding to climate change and assist us in predicting rates of sea level change. 
The map in the app of changes in surface elevation is one of several measurements to determine overall change in the size of the Antarctic ice sheet.
</p>
<p>
The physical characteristics of the surface of the ice sheet are affected by the ocean, the atmosphere and the compaction of the ice itself. 
Scientists use a quantity known as the surface mass balance (SMB) of the ice sheet to help simplify the complex interactions of the ice, air and water. 
Simply stated the ice sheet's SMB can be described as a balance between the <a href="#snowfall" data-rel="popup">inputs</a> and <a href="#outputs" data-rel="popup">outputs</a> of ice mass. 
Annually adding snow  increases the surface elevation of the ice sheet and the overall SMB, while removing snow through sublimation and melting 
will lower both the elevation and the SMB. As <a href="#firn" data-rel="popup">surface</a> snow is buried it becomes compacted and therefore more dense, ultimately reducing surface elevation. 
Ice compaction, through aging of the ice crystals, will change ice sheet elevation but not overall ice mass. 
</p>
<p>
Ice shelves form around the perimeter of Antarctica (shown in light grey in the app image) where ice flows off the continent. Acting like barricades for the ice sheet behind them, they provide back stress to slow ice flow off the continent. 
Their direct contact with the ocean makes them susceptible to melting from a warming ocean. Recently scientists have studied increased melt at the 
base of the Antarctic ice shelves, citing this as a major source of ice loss. This melting weakens the ice shelves and can cause their collapse, 
which allows more ice to flow off the land into the ocean.

<p>
When an ice sheet is stable it has a fairly constant balance of inputs and outputs. West Antarctica is currently not stable, it is thinning, losing mass. One of the
fastest changing areas of the Antarctic ice sheet is along the Amundsen Sea as it borders West Antarctica, the region shown in the image to the left. 
The combination of glaciers shown in red in the image drain deep into the interior, pulling ice from a large section of the West Antarctic ice sheet. 
</p>

<p>
In order to know how the ice sheet is thinning, researchers need to track changes in the height of the ice surface relative to some reference surface. 
A primary technique used today is based on transmitting short laser pulses (LiDAR) from either satellites or airplanes. Like radar, LiDAR relies on timing the delay between transmission and reception of an emitted light pulse towards the Earth's surface.

The ICESat I satellite operated until 2009 (ICESat II is scheduled to be launched soon) with an altimeter emitting laser pulses with wavelengths at both <a href="#green" data-rel="popup">532 nm</a> and <a href="#infrared" data-rel="popup">1064 nm</a> for surface altimetry and clouds/aerosols, respectively.  
Pulses were emitted 40 times per second from an altitude of of about <a href="#metric" data-rel="popup">600 km</a> above the Earth's surface. Each pulse sequentially lights up patches on the ground, each about <a href="#metric1" data-rel="popup">70 m</a> in diameter separated by about <a href="#metric2" data-rel="popup">170 m</a>. 
The satellite can measure surface elevation change with an accuracy of <a href="#metric3" data-rel="popup">14 cm</a>. 
Between the ICESat programs, NASA has run a data collection program called IceBridge flying aeroplanes over the ice sheet.

<p>
Zoom to Antarctica using the map. The red and yellow colors show areas where the ice surface is lowering. 
These are primarily areas at low elevations near the ice sheet margins and fast flowing glaciers. 
The blue colors show areas where the ice surface height is increasing. This arises from either increases in snowfall or a slow-down in ice speed. 
Notice that there are not many blue areas. The dark grey areas show where there is no or insufficient data. 
The center of Antarctica is poorly covered by satellites so this large area is grey. The light grey areas around the edges of the continent are the ice shelves, 
(described above).  
The map data in PolarExplorer App is representative of the period from 1992-2008 and has been compiled by CSIRO.
