<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
An individual's fingerprints are known as unique identifiers, often linked to a crime scene investigation. 
Detectives uncover a fingerprint, providing a point of origin or a link to a specific individual, and in such a case the fingerprint is used as evidence linking back to the perpetrator of a crime.
Scientists, like detectives, examine evidence and review the data to link the <i>fingerprint</i> of an action to a specific point of origin. 
In the case of ice sheets, scientists have proposed that if there were rapid ice melt of the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets each would have a unique geographic impact on sea level change. 
This geographic impact, or pattern of response, has been nicknamed a <i>fingerprint</i> because of its distinct link to the source. The maps displayed in the app are created to model the fingerprint or impact of sea level rise given the rapid melt of each ice sheet.

<p>
Antarctica and Greenland are covered in thick deep ice (see ice thickness maps). Both land areas are primarily covered by ice, with Antarctic ice extending almost 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles) 
and Greenlandâ€™s ice about 1.7 million square kilometers (656,000 square miles). Add to the ice extent thicknesses of ~4 kms of ice near the center of Antarctica and ~ 2 kms of ice at the center of Greenland, 
and you have vast expanses of ice stacked up like mountains. These large ice masses provide significant gravitational attractions, pulling at the surrounding ocean water. 
This gravitational attraction from the ice has caused the ocean around Greenland and Antarctica to pile up, resulting in local sea level rise.
</p>
<p>
But what happened in the past when these ice sheets went through periods of melt and what will happen in the future? 
What is the impact when the ice sheets accelerate in their melting and start to lose large amounts of ice mass? 
The geologic record contains ancient sea markers from past warm periods, clues that can be used to piece together the areas of impact from the warming ice sheets during the warm interglacials. 
Scientists have been studying these geologic periods for clues to the present. 
</p>

<p>
The melting ice will increase the water volume in the ocean, 
but the additional melt water will not increase sea level around the world evenly. Working with clues from past sea level change and using different models of the Earth 
(e.g. elastic, rigid, compressible and non-compressible, rotating), predicted future impacts have been developed. Although the ice melt model results have some small variance 
in the amount of sea level drop and how far the ice drop extends (near field effect), overall they show strong consistency in the geographic redistribution of ocean water in the far field.  
</p>

<p>
The models predict that areas within ~2000 to 2500 km of Greenland and Antarctica will see the water relax away from the land and sea level 
will drop as the gravitational attraction weakens with ice loss. 
Greenland ice sheet loss would disproportionately raise sea level in South America, while West Antarctica ice sheet loss would disproportionately affect the 
North Atlantic and Pacific Coastal regions. The computations, numerical models and parameters used in the calculations of the models are much more complex than what is described here.

Zoom to two maps. The blue colors represent sea level drop caused by rapid ice loss from the ice sheet shown. 
The dark red areas show where sea level will rise due to the redistribution of the ocean water currently attracted to each ice sheet.
