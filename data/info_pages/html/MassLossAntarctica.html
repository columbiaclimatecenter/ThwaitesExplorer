<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
<i>Mass Loss</i> is the term for an overall reduction in the amount of ice in an ice sheet. The loss of ice mass is measurable from space by the 
use of twin satellites. NASA's GRACE satellites work together using gravitational attraction to track how water moves and is stored on Earth. The ice sheets represent a major storage of water, 
with any change in ice mass affecting their pattern of rotation as they circulate the Earth.
A loss of ice equates to a loss of gravitational attraction between the ice sheet and the satellites. The Antarctic ice sheet is overall losing ice, primarily on the 
West Antarctic coast line and along the peninsula. Loss of ice from the Antarctic ice sheet results in sea level rise around the world.

Antarctica and Greenland are covered in thick deep ice (see ice thickness maps), with both land areas are primarily covered by ice. Antarctic ice extends almost 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles) 
and Greenlandâ€™s ice about 1.7 million square kilometers (656,000 square miles). Add to the ice extent thicknesses of ~4 kms of ice near the center of Antarctica and ~ 2 kms of ice at the center of Greenland, 
and you have vast expanses of ice stacked up like mountains. These large ice masses provide significant gravitational attractions which can be detected by satellites orbiting overhead.

<p>
NASA's GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) twin satellites launched in 2002 to monitor the storage of water on Earth. Changes in water collected in oceans, rivers, groundwater and ice sheets is detectable by 
a shift in the gravitational attraction they exert on the satellites. As the satellites orbit the accelerate as they approach a massive feature on Earth and slow as they move away. Water and ice have less mass than the 
Earth's interior, but they also change more rapidly than Earth's interior making them trackable by the satellites. Orbiting at a set distance 220 kilometers apart (137 miles), the two GRACE satellites move closer together or 
further apart with the slight changes in mass from a loss of ice. The change in distance is not large, a fraction the diameter of a human hair! This very small alteration in their relationship is detected by the time of 
arrival of a stream of microwave pulses that are beamed between the satellites.</p>

Collecting data of the size of an ice sheet is a daunting task. The scale of the ice sheets, their remoteness and the inhospitable conditions of the extreme polar climates combine to make these  
areas extremely difficult to measure. Prior to 2002 when the GRACE satellites were put into orbit data on the loss of ice mass was collected through a combination of different techniques including 
the drops in ice elevation. With the GRACE measurements our accuracy has improved showing that we had previously underestimated ice loss from the ice sheets, and that ice loss is accelerating. 
Data from NASA's GRACE satellites show that both our ice sheets are losing mass since the satellites were put in orbit in March 2002. The continent of Antarctica has been losing about 118 gigatonnes 
of ice per year mostly from West Antarctica, equating to about one quarter of a millimeter of annual sea level rise from the overall 3 mm global average.

Antarctica holds enough ice to raise sea level around the world by 60 meters (200 feet) were it all to melt. We have not had an ice free Antarctica for millions of years, but if even a fraction of this 
ice were to melt into the oceans many major coastal cities around the world would be flooded. Click on the map to explore the areas of change in the ice sheet. Most of the ice loss has occurred on 
West Antarctica in the section along the Amundsen Sea where Thwaites and Pine Island glacier empty. This region of the ice sheet has been called the 'weak underbelly' of Antarctica due to its connection  
far back into the ice sheet, allowing ice melt to have a runaway effect. Dark regions in the image are experiencing accelerated ice loss while blue areas are seeing ice gain. Ice loss vastly overruns ice gain.
