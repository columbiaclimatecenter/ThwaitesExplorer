Observed Southern Ocean Temperature: This map shows observed Southern Ocean temperatures collected at a depth of 550m. Ocean temperature is an important factor in glacial ice melt where there is direct contact. Antarctica is completely surrounded by the Southern Ocean, and Antarctic ice extends to the very edge of the land, and even beyond as floating ice shelves, for most of the coastline. The warmer the ocean water the greater potential for high ice melt rates. Click on the map for ocean temperature data collected over many years and projects and compiled in the 2018 World Ocean Atlas. Compare the deep ocean temperature near Thwaites to other areas of the Antarctic coastline. The ITGC TARSAN Project will collect ocean temperature measurements along the front of Thwaites Glaciers to contribute to this understanding of the interactions between Thwaites and the Southern Ocean.
